# Advent of Code 2025 solutions

These are my solutions for the [2025 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2025) of the annual event **Advent of Code**.
Each solution is in [src/](src/), in either Java, Rust, C++, OCaml, Tcl, or Python.


## Helper scripts

- [setup_day.sh](setup_day.sh)[^.env]  
  Creates a new source code file in [src/](src/) from one of the templates in templates/
  and downloads the day's input to inputs/.
- [run.sh](run.sh)[^.env]  
  Compiles and runs the solution in any language for the specified day (or today,
  if none is specified).

[^.env]: You need to set the `SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable. You can do so by creating a .env file. You can get your AoC session token from your cookies after logging in. In case of run.sh, it's just needed to automatically submit the solution.
